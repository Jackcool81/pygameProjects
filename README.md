# pygameProjects

A collection of a few Pygame Projects I worked on as a passion project, for school, and for work. The Project1 and 2 are for my Visual Art Class where I made a Midi Visualizer in Project 1 capable of taking in a midi input and creating shapes on the pygame screen. Project 2 includes the animation seen on my website. The journey to the west project includes a game I worked on with a student, it lacks some documentation as I did not start the project with her but I helped add features to it as well as music and sound!
